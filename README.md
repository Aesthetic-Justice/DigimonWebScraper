## Description

The purpose of this application is to (gently) target the official DigimonTCG website and make an offline copy of all of the card information contained on the consumer-facing end of their card database. This application was created to refamiliarize myself with coding in C++ while doing so in the VScode IDE as I had previously only done so in Visual Studio.
